# go-neuralnet

A neural network made from scratch in go

### Usage:

To run:

```
go run main.go
```

To build:

```
go build
```

### About:

The purpose for building this neural network was to learn more about how neural networks operate.
This project is built on top of gonum, so that I could construct the inner workings of the neural network.

The data set used when constructing this neural network is the famous iris flower dataset (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set). The neural network is able to classify the iris flowers in the dataset with aproximately 96% accuracy.
